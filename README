===Licensing===
The license of the kickgen.pl script is unclear. It was
originally written by Jerome Delamarche and hosted at
http://www.trickytools.com/php/kickgen.php but no license 
terms are given

All other scripts have been written by and are under the
copyright of Bryan Berry, they are under the Apache 2.0
license. 

===Purpose===

The script will output a kickstart file that you can use to
rebuild your system from scratch. There are additional scripts 
that you can use to distribute this script to multiple servers
and to collect them back to a central point periodically.

This script is not thoroughly tested

===Basic Usage===

$ ./kickgen.pl   # outputs the kickstart file to stdout

$ ./kickgen.pl  2> /dev/null > ks.cfg  # output 

$ fab -H localhost install # put the kickgen.pl on a server
                             and installs cron job to run it nightly

$ fab -H host1,host2,host3  install # install on multiple hosts

$ ./factory.py hosts.txt install  
# install kickgen.pl on all hostnames listed in hosts.txt 
# hostnames should be one per line

$ ./collector.py  hosts.txt # collects generated files and stores them
				in a local cache					

===Dependencies===

kickgen.pl requires you have XML::Simple and XML::Parser
libraries installed somewhere on your system.

$ yum install perl-XML-Simple

fabfile.py depends on the excellent python library Fabric
See http://fabfile.org for details

It is a pain to install on RHEL 5


This script has a number of components

===Quick Summary===

kickgen.pl runs locally on your rhel host and generates an up-to-date
kickstart file that can be used for disaster recovery. 

fabric  http://www.fabfile.org a tool for remote job execution 
written in Python

factory.py takes a list of hosts, a fabric command, and runs 
each command in a separate subprocess. By default, fabric
will only run for a total of 240s (4 minutes) before it
starts killing subprocesses that it presumes are running
too long 

collectory.py -- this script collects the generated kickstart files
and copies them over to the repo server at FAO 


===How Everything Works===

kickgen.pl runs locally on your rhel host and generates an up-to-date
kickstart file that can be for disaster recovery. It has one big
known bug, it cannot handle HP hardware RAID array. As a crappy fix
I output the stdout of df -h and lvdisplay at the end of the file
so you can piece together the partition info by hand. These lines 
are prefixed with '#' so they won't cause errors in your kickstart.  

===Caveat Emptor===

This script has not been thoroughly tested, particularly with 
HP HW RAID drives
